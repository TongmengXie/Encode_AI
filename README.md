# WanderMatch

WanderMatch is an application that helps users find compatible travel companions, generate personalized itineraries, and create travel blogs based on user preferences.

## Features

- **User Profile Creation**: Collect travel preferences and personal information through an interactive survey
- **Partner Matching**: Match users with compatible travel companions using AI-powered similarity analysis
- **Transport Comparison**: Compare different transportation options (flight, train, bus, car) with detailed information on duration, cost, carbon footprint, comfort level, and pros/cons
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize travel routes with interactive Folium maps showing attractions and travel paths
- **Blog Generation**: Automatically create travel blogs using AI (Gemini or OpenAI) with personalized content based on user profile and travel details
- **Itinerary Planning**: Generate customized travel plans with attractions, route points, and timelines

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key (optional)
   ```

4. Ensure required directories exist:
   ```
   mkdir -p UserInfo_and_Match/survey_results
   mkdir -p get_user_info/backend
   mkdir -p wandermatch_output/maps
   mkdir -p wandermatch_output/blogs
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```

3. Select a travel companion or choose to travel solo

4. Enter your origin and destination cities

5. Compare transportation options:
   - View an interactive HTML comparison of different transport modes
   - See details about duration, cost, carbon footprint, and comfort
   - Select your preferred option

6. Review your generated travel route:
   - An interactive map will open in your browser
   - View the route, attractions, and key information
   
7. Explore your personalized travel blog:

## Transportation Features

The transportation system provides:
- AI-generated transport options using Gemini and OpenAI
- Fallback to default options when APIs are unavailable
- Detailed comparison of transport modes (flight, train, bus, car)
- Interactive HTML visualization with responsive cards
- Color-coded carbon footprint indicators
- Terminal-based selection interface with Rich formatting

## Map Visualization

The map generation system offers:
- Interactive Folium maps of travel routes
- Markers for origin, destination, and attractions
- Popup information for key locations
- Clustering of nearby attractions
- Color-coded route lines based on transport mode
- Support for multiple geocoding services

## Blog Generation

The blog creation system features:
- AI-powered blog generation using Gemini or OpenAI
- Templated blog generation as a fallback
- Personalization based on user profile and travel details
- Markdown formatting with structured sections
- Conversion to HTML with styled presentation
- Automatic browser opening to display blogs

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Gemini API key
- Google Maps API key (optional, for enhanced geocoding)
- Required packages listed in requirements.txt

## Fallback Mechanisms

The application implements robust fallback mechanisms:
- Server-side storage with proper error handling and reporting
- Multiple encoding attempts for CSV files to prevent Unicode errors
- Directory path validation with alternative paths if standard paths are unavailable
- Cascading API services (Gemini → OpenAI → templates)
- Default transport options when API services are unavailable
- Multiple geocoding service options if the primary service fails

## Troubleshooting

- **Server connectivity issues**: Ensure the survey server is running with `python get_user_info/start_server.py`
- **Missing CSV files**: Check server logs and verify directory permissions for survey_results
- **Unicode errors**: Check encoding settings in both server and database connections
- **API connection issues**: Verify API keys and internet connectivity
- **Match quality issues**: Ensure survey completion and check matching algorithm settings
- **Map display problems**: Ensure Folium is properly installed and browser access is available
- **Transport API failures**: The system will automatically use default transport options
