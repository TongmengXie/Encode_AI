# ✈️ Project Name: **WanderMatch**

---

## 📌 Summary

**WanderMatch** is a travel matchmaking and recommendation platform designed for adventure-seekers looking to connect with like-minded travelers. Our app lets users fill out a simple form with their travel preferences, matches them with a potential travel partner, recommends an optimized travel route based on their combined preferences, and finally generates a shareable content piece summarizing their trip plan.

Built during [Hackathon Name], WanderMatch aims to streamline travel planning while fostering meaningful connections.

## 📖 Overview

The application workflow consists of three core features:

1. **Travel Mate Recommendation**  
   Based on a user's submitted preferences (destination type, travel budget, preferred activities, etc.), the system identifies and recommends a compatible travel partner.

2. **Route Recommendation**  
   Once paired, WanderMatch proposes an optimized travel route tailored to the duo's shared interests and constraints.

3. **AI-Powered Content Generation**  
   Finally, the app auto-generates a personalized travel content piece — a blog post or social media caption — summarizing their travel plan, destinations, and highlights.

## 🛠️ How Sponsor Tech Was Used

- **Sponsor API / SDK (replace this with actual tech sponsor)**  
  We integrated **Sponsor API** to fetch real-time data (e.g. travel destinations, route suggestions, or content templates) and incorporated it into our matchmaking and content generation logic.  
  Example: Used the `getSuggestedRoutes()` method from Sponsor SDK to propose efficient and scenic routes based on travel data.

## 📝 Core Pseudocode (main.py)

```python
# Config switches
ENABLE_PARTNER_RECOMMENDATION = True
ENABLE_ROUTE_RECOMMENDATION = True
ENABLE_CONTENT_GENERATION = True
SKIP_USER_INPUT = False  # If True, auto-generate answers for skipped questions

# Step 1: Get user data
if SKIP_USER_INPUT:
    user_data = generate_random_user_data()
else:
    user_data = get_user_data()

# Step 2: Partner recommendation
if ENABLE_PARTNER_RECOMMENDATION:
    partner_list = recommend_partners(user_data)

# Step 3: Route recommendation
if ENABLE_ROUTE_RECOMMENDATION:
    route_list = recommend_routes(user_data)

# Step 4: Content generation
if ENABLE_CONTENT_GENERATION:
    content = generate_content(user_data, partner_list, route_list)
    print(content)

```python
