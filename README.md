## Troubleshooting

### Network and CORS Issues

If you encounter errors related to NetworkError or CORS:

1. **Check the browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify API URLs**: Ensure the frontend is correctly connecting to the backend
3. **CORS Configuration**: The backend has built-in CORS support but may need adjustments for custom domains
4. **Test Connection**: Use the `/api/health` or `/api/cors-test` endpoints to diagnose connection issues

### Blog Generation Issues

If blog generation fails:

1. **Check API keys**: Both OpenAI and Gemini keys should be valid
2. **Verify module imports**: Ensure blog_generator.py is accessible to the backend
3. **Check file permissions**: The output directory needs write permissions
4. **Examine server logs**: Detailed error information is logged on the server side
5. **Network connectivity**: Ensure the frontend can reach the backend API

### Node.js and npm Issues

If you encounter errors related to Node.js or npm:

1. **Verify Node.js Installation**
   - Ensure Node.js is installed by running: `node --version`
   - If not installed, download it from https://nodejs.org/
   - Ensure you install the LTS (Long Term Support) version

2. **Path Issues**
   - Make sure Node.js is in your PATH environment variable
   - On Windows, the installer should add it automatically
   - You may need to restart your terminal or computer after installation

3. **npm Not Found**
   - npm comes with Node.js installation but might not be in the PATH
   - On Windows, check if npm.cmd exists in the same folder as node.exe
   - Try reinstalling Node.js if npm is missing

4. **Permission Issues**
   - On Linux/Mac, you might need to run commands with sudo
   - On Windows, try running your terminal as administrator

5. **Manual Installation Verification**
   - Our verification script can help diagnose issues:
   ```
   cd deploy
   python verify_setup.py
   ```

### Other Common Issues

- **Survey data not saving**
   - Check the console output for the path where data is being saved
   - Ensure the directory exists and is writable
   - The backend tries to save to the original location at `../../UserInfo_and_Match/survey_results`

- **API connection issues**: Verify API keys and internet connectivity
- **Map display problems**: Ensure Folium is properly installed and browser access is available
- **Transport API failures**: The system will automatically use default transport options

## OpenAI API Quota Management

### Current Issue

The application uses OpenAI's embedding model to calculate similarity between survey responses. If you encounter an error like:

```
Error running embedding calculation: Server responded with status: 429
```

This means the API key has reached its usage limit. OpenAI imposes rate limits and quota limits on API keys.

### Solutions

1. **Use a different API key**: Update the `.env` file with a new API key.

2. **Use the demo mode**: The application now has a fallback demo mode that uses pre-calculated matches when the API quota is exceeded. You'll be prompted to enable this mode when an API quota error occurs.

3. **Wait and try again later**: Quotas often reset after a certain period (typically monthly).

4. **Increase your OpenAI API usage tier**: Visit the [OpenAI billing page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview) to increase your usage limits.

### For Developers

If you're extending this application, consider implementing:

- Local caching of embeddings (already implemented)
- Batch processing to optimize API calls
- Alternative embedding models, like those from Hugging Face that can run locally
- Fallback mechanisms for when the API is unavailable
