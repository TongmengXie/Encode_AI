So, Jie Zhang and I just got back from an epic seven-day road trip from Bath to Paris, and let me tell you, it was an adventure! We'd been dreaming about this trip for ages, poring over maps, bookmarking quaint villages, and arguing (good-naturedly, of course) over which cheese shops were absolutely essential.  We decided to drive, giving us the freedom to explore at our own pace and veer off the beaten path whenever the mood struck.  And believe me, it struck often.

Bath was our starting point, and what a start! The Roman Baths themselves were breathtaking.  Standing there, imagining the Romans soaking in the same waters centuries ago, was surreal.  We wandered the honey-colored streets, admiring the Georgian architecture and popping into charming little shops.  We even treated ourselves to afternoon tea, complete with scones and clotted cream – a truly quintessential British experience.  Jie, ever the pragmatist, made sure we had downloaded offline maps, which proved invaluable as we navigated the narrow, winding roads out of the city.

Our first stop after Bath was Stonehenge.  I've always been fascinated by ancient history, and seeing those massive stones standing in the middle of the Salisbury Plain was truly awe-inspiring.  The sheer scale of it, the mystery surrounding its purpose – it's just incredible.  Jie, who’s a bit more scientifically minded, was busy snapping photos and trying to calculate the weight of the stones.  We had a good-natured debate about aliens versus Neolithic ingenuity, a conversation that continued well into our drive.

We spent the next couple of days meandering through the English countryside. We stumbled upon a tiny village pub in the Cotswolds, where we had the best fish and chips of our lives and chatted with the friendly locals.  The rolling hills, dotted with sheep and charming stone cottages, were like something out of a postcard.  Jie, a keen photographer, couldn’t resist capturing every picturesque scene.  I must admit, even I, not usually one for excessive photos, was snapping away.

Crossing the Channel was another adventure. We opted for the ferry, and the sight of the white cliffs of Dover receding in the distance was strangely emotional. It felt like we were truly leaving one chapter behind and starting another.  France greeted us with sunshine and the promise of even more delicious food. Our first French meal was a simple baguette, cheese, and wine picnic overlooking the Normandy coast.  Simple, yes, but absolutely perfect.  Jie, who speaks fluent French, charmed the local baker into giving us a freshly baked baguette still warm from the oven.  It was heavenly.


We spent a day exploring the D-Day landing beaches, a sobering and deeply moving experience. Walking along those sands, imagining the events that unfolded there, was incredibly powerful.  Jie and I spent a long time in silence, just absorbing the atmosphere and reflecting on the sacrifices made.  It was a reminder that even amidst the beauty of a road trip, it’s important to remember the history of the places we visit.

Then it was on to Paris!  Driving into the city was a bit chaotic, but we eventually found our hotel and settled in.  Paris was everything I’d imagined and more. The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre Dame (sadly still under reconstruction), the charming cafes, the bustling streets – it was a sensory overload in the best possible way.  We spent our days exploring the city on foot, getting blissfully lost in the maze of narrow streets and stumbling upon hidden courtyards.  Jie, with her impeccable sense of direction, somehow managed to navigate us back to the hotel every evening.

Of course, no trip to Paris is complete without indulging in the local cuisine. We sampled everything from croissants and macarons to steak frites and escargots.  One evening, we found a tiny bistro tucked away in a quiet alleyway. The food was incredible, the wine flowed freely, and we spent hours chatting with the owner, a charming older gentleman who regaled us with stories of old Paris.  Jie, with her fluent French, effortlessly translated his tales, making the evening even more special.


Our final day in Paris was bittersweet.  We climbed the Arc de Triomphe for one last panoramic view of the city.  The sprawling cityscape, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, was breathtaking.  We stood there for a long time, just soaking it all in, a mix of exhaustion and exhilaration coursing through us.  It was the perfect ending to an unforgettable journey.

Driving back to the UK felt like the closing of a chapter.  We were tired, our car was packed with souvenirs, and our wallets were considerably lighter, but our hearts were full.  The trip was more than just a collection of sights ticked off a list. It was a shared experience, a collection of memories, laughter, and conversations that strengthened our friendship.  We learned a lot about each other, about the countries we visited, and about ourselves. And that, I think, is the true magic of travel.  Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.  Maybe next time we’ll tackle Italy.  Jie, are you reading this?  Start planning!
